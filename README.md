# Evaluation-for-establishing-new-retail-store
In this project I have classified several places which are fit to open new stores using Logistic Regression based on several factors.
It is useful for clients(retailers) who are going to open new stores without hassle.
I created model on 70% of the cleaned data and did validation on 30% of the cleaned data and finally apply that model on test dataset.
